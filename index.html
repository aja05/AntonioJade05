              <p>In my journey since my Elementary days until I become a college student still the same, I really curios in computers how it works and how it gives a data in just one click. How the different platforms put in a one processor or storage, after graduating in elementary, in my junior high I also discover how to use the basic hand keyboard, how to make a document ,before in Sagada National high SChool I'm grade 7 then we have a ICT and I'm very happy because I already learning about the basic parts and about how to input data and put my fingers in keyboard, before my teacher challenge us to finish the document to see how fast we are to input the data and tada! I'm the second who finished the document. After that I transferred in Tarabucan National High School, new environment and new adjustment, I become an artist and dancers. In my 8 grade become a Top 1 in our section consistent, until I became grade 10 and I graduated with achiever/honor student. and grade 11 I am a GAS student still in TNHS, we have a ICT again and we learn how binary works and how it gives a data in just binary 1 and 0 (on and off) before I really don't understand how it really works beacause we have just 6 months to learn and not all of us get it easily. Then after graduated in grade 12 in San Policarpo National High School, I am just graduate but before that I already choose what course or program I want to take in College which is Information Technology. Even though my result in my NCAE is Culinary arts, but still I choose what I curios about. And finally after taking a entrance exam I got the slot and I passed the examination interview for IT and now I graduated in my very wanted program.</p>
